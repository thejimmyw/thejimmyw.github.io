			<h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<p>My name is James (but I prefer to go by Jimmy) and I have always had a strong interest in computers and games. I still remember getting my first computer back when I was young and it definitely changed my life! Ever since I've spent hours learning about both computer hardware and computer programming. I was once the family tech-support expert and helped with everything from simply creating bookmarks to writing software and fixing or servicing desktops, laptops and mobile devices.<br><br>During my primary school years, I happened to become the school's IT expert by accident. I happened to suggest a solution to a tech problem and that seemed to cause the <em>"I'm not sure how to do this. Better ask Jimmy"</em> mindset. In high school, however, I was one of a few like-minded peers who became the go-to IT experts and I frequently consulted with the school's IT technician to resolve issues.</p>
